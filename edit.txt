The main idea is to have 2 blocks of code:

if( isset($_POST['nameOfYourForm']) )

Here you will update data

And else

Here you will select data from database and render you form with set data

you have to have something that is pointing to the item you are editing  in URL address.. eg. id.
let's say, you have a page with edit button:

<a href="your_script_with_form_filled_with_data.php?id=<?php echo $hardcodedOrSelectedFromDatabaseId; ?>">Edit</a>

going back to that "else" part that I mentioned before:

else {

    // here you have to get that id from url param. like this:
    $id = $_GET['id'];

    // then using this value, select appropriate item from db:
    $record = mysqli_query($db, "SELECT * FROM your_table_name_with_items_you_want_to_edit WHERE id=$id");

		if (count($record) == 1 ) {
			$n = mysqli_fetch_array($record);
			$field1 = $n['field1'];
			$field2 = $n['field2'];
		}

}

and then set these values as inputs' values

<input type="text" name="field1" value="<?php echo $field1; ?>">
<input type="text" name="field2" value="<?php echo $field2; ?>">
